# voting_management_system
The Voting Management System is a Python-based application that manages the election process efficiently. It allows voter registration, candidate addition, secure vote casting, result display, and voter status checking. The system ensures that each voter can vote only once, maintaining fairness, accuracy, and transparency.
On online,voting may be not secured and cause many problems like fake voting etc.
to reduce those problems we introduce this system.
This application is user friendly and very easy to use. Thankyou!
